# SQL_For_Data_Analysis

I am using examples from https://www.stratascratch.com/ 
These examples are from big companies interviews. They are similar to real life problems that a data analyst might need to resolve.

I am trying to show case more advance methods to solve problems and learn along side.

The repository structued based on the solutions that I suggested for each problem.
window folder: the problems are solved by using sql window functions.
